## Lighting Workshop
### Steps

1. **Verify Lighting Settings**  
   Go to the **Lighting** tab: `Window > Rendering > Lighting`.
   - Create a new Lighting Setting if one doesn't exist already.
   - Ensure the following settings are applied:
     - **Mixed Lighting**:
       - Enable **Baked Global Illumination**
       - Set **Lighting Mode** to **Baked Indirect**
     - **Lightmapping Settings**:
       - **Lightmapper**: Progressive GPU
       - **Lightmap Resolution**: 10
       - **Max Lightmap Size**: 512
       - **Lightmap Compression**: Low Quality
     - Confirm **Auto Generate** is unchecked.

2. **Open the Lightmaps Scene**  
   - Youâ€™ll see a furnished house, but it's lacking a lot of light. Your task will be to add that light.

3. **Add Light Fixtures**  
   - In **Assets**: `Lightmaps > nappin > House Props Softpack > Prefabs > Lights`, select various lamp models.
   - Place them around the house as desired.
     - Customize the light color, intensity, etc., but keep them set as **baked lights**.

4. **Bake and Save Lightmaps**
   - In `Scenes > Lightmaps`, locate `LightingData` and delete it.
   - Go to the **Lighting** tab and click **Generate Lights** to bake the lights.
   - Once complete:
     - Save the generated lightmaps to a folder named `Mode1`.
     - Delete the `LightingData` file again.

5. **Adjust Lights for a New Mode**
   - Modify lights by changing their colors, placement, or removing some entirely.
   - Bake lights again and save this new lightmap setup in a folder named `Mode2`.

6. **Set Up Light Switching**
   - Find the `LightSwitch` object in the **Inspector**.
   - Add each lightmap (Mode1 and Mode2) to the respective slots in `LightSwitch`.
   
7. **Test Lightmap Switching**
   - Enter **Play Mode**:
     - Press **Space** to switch between lightmaps when inside the house.
     - When outside, the lights "turn off" using a lightmap with no added lights.

## Technical Applications

- Baked lighting reduces real-time rendering load.
- Light probes provide consistent lights and shadows across different scenarios.
- Allows for rapid, cost-effective, and impactful adjustments to lighting.
